#Ways to interpret Bushu_Tierlist data:
#1) The Summed score is a good measure of the total value of a given bushu
#2) Truncated count is a good measure of the relative difficulty or size of the task your undertaking
#3) Therefore the efficiency score is just that, a quotient of the two telling you essentially time to value ratio.

"""
The efficiency measure alone isn't the best way to rank bushu because if the count is a tiny number
you're task will be complete and the effort you put in to game-fying the category isn't really worth it.

BIG NOTE:
Btw, you should think about bringing together certain radical categories.
Stuff like 月 - つき + 月 - にくづき
Or 目 - め + 目 - めへん
Essentially things that are the same symbol but in different positions of the kanji. 
This will create further differentiation which will help the fun part of categorization.

This can also be done for visually similar kanji like those two へんs that look like 祈's へん
It's only useful if the underlying categories are small to begin with. Combining two 30 stack high lists is overwhelming.
